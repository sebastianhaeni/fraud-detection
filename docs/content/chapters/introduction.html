  <h3>Competition</h3>
  <p>
    The goal of this project was to participate in the Data Mining Cup 2019 and produce a report about it as well as
    code artifacts used to solve the challenge. The following chapter gives an overview of the Data Mining Cup and the
    Challenge 2019. The following content a copy from the <a href="#ref-dmc">Data Mining Cup website</a>.

  <h3>Data Mining Cup</h3>

  <p>
    The DATA MINING CUP (DMC for short) has inspired students around the world to pursue intelligent data analysis since
    the year 2000. In the 20th DATA MINING CUP in 2019 about 150 teams from 114 universities in 28 countries took part
    in the competition. The best teams were invited to Berlin for the awards ceremony at the retail intelligence summit.

  <h4>Challenge 2019</h4>

  <p>
    The number of self-checkout stations is on the rise. This includes stationary self-checkouts, where customers take
    their shopping cart to a scan station and pay for their products. Secondly, there are semi-stationary
    self-checkouts, where customers scan their products directly and only pay at a counter. The customers either use
    their own smartphone for scanning or the store provides mobile scanners. You will probably have encountered this
    already.
  </p>

  <p>
    This automated process helps avoid long lines and speeds up the paying process for individual customers. But how
    can retailers prevent the trust they have placed in customers from being abused? How can they decide which purchases
    to check in an effort to expose fraudsters without annoying innocent customers?
  </p>

  <h4>Scenario</h4>

  <p>
    An established food retailer has introduced a self-scanning system that allows customers to scan their items using a
    handheld mobile scanner while shopping
  </p>
  <p>
    This type of payment leaves retailers open to the risk that a certain number of customers will take advantage of
    this freedom to commit fraud by not scanning all of the items in their cart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Empirical research conducted by suppliers has shown that discrepancies are found in approximately 5 % of all
    self-scan transactions. The research does not differentiate between actual fraudulent intent of the customer,
    inadvertent errors or technical problems with scanners.
  </p>

  <h4>Task</h4>

  <p>
    To minimize losses, the food retailer hopes to identify cases of fraud using targeted follow-up checks. The
    challenge here is to keep the number of checks as low as possible to avoid unnecessary added expense as well as to
    avoid putting off innocent customers due to false accusations. At the same time, however, the goal is to identify as
    many false scans as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    The objective of the participating teams is to create a model to classify the scans as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
    The classification does not take into account whether the fraud was committed intentionally or inadvertently.
  </p>

  <h4>Evaluation</h4>
  <p>
    The solutions submitted will be assessed and compared based on their monetary value for the food retailer. This can
    be calculated using the following cost matrix based on empirical observation.
